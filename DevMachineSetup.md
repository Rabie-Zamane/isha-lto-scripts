# Introduction #

I need somewhere where I can test the ts4isha and lto4isha code and fix bugs, download and install random things etc... without messing up the production processes we have in place. For this purpose I have set up a Virtual Machine on Media-1, running CentOS. The advantage of a VM is that no matter how much I mess it up, all damage is restricted to the VM image file, without any effect on the day to day work happening on the host machine.
