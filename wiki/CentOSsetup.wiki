#summary Instructions on how to configure CentOS with necessary software

= Introduction =

This document contains the instructions on how to install and configure the CentOS Operating System, installing the necessary software and hardware, to be able to perform the LTO backups, and to run the TranscriptStudio application.


== Why CentOS ==

We have chosen to use the Linux OS because it is generally considered to offer greater stability, security when compared to Microsoft Windows. We also wanted to use an open source model for our data backup architecture, to avoid storing our data in proprietary formats, and therefore avoid the risk of being unable to access it in the future due to software version incompatibilities or discontinuities. For this reason Linux was the natural choice. 

The reason why we have chosen the CentOS distribution of Linux is primarily because we are using an HP Tape Drive (Storageworks Ultrium 920 External SCSI) together with an HP SCSI HBA Card [http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareIndex.jsp?lang=en&cc=us&prodNameId=3191202&prodTypeId=329290&prodSeriesId=3191201&swLang=8&taskId=135&swEnvOID=4006 (SC11Xe PCIe Ultra320)], both of which are only supported, (and have drivers/firmware available) for the enterprise versions of either RHEL or SUSE. 

CentOS aims to be, as far as possible, a "binary clone" of RHEL (using the freely available source code under the GPL license), but with the advantage of being free. Using an "enterprise" distribution also means that we are less at risk from bugs introduced by having the "latest and greatest" updates, which might be the case with using an OS like Ubuntu for example.

== Hardware Installation ==

We are using the following hardware:
  * IBM System x3400 (7973) Server
  * HP Storageworks Ultrium 920 LTO-3 External Scsi Tape Drive
  * HP SC11Xe Ultra 320 PCIe HBA card (OEM version of LSI card)
  * 2 Western Digital Velociraptor 10000rpm 300GB Sata Hard Disks

=== Installing the HP SC11Xe HBA card ===

The latest driver for this card is available [http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareDescription.jsp?lang=en&cc=uk&prodTypeId=329290&prodSeriesId=3191201&swItem=MTX-0cfb66c3937346129f6ce9ed13&prodNameId=3191202&swEnvOID=4006&swLang=8&taskId=135&mode=4&idx=2 here]. Note that we are using the driver for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Server (x86) operating system. At the time of writing the driver version was 4.00.13.04-6 (19 Feb 2009).

After downloading the rpm file from the HP site, a couple of things need to be done to make the installation work.

  # Change the value stored in the file /etc/redhat-release from "CentOS release 5.3 (Final)" to "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5 (Tikanga)". If you don't do this, then the the installation will fail with a message saying that you don't have the correct distribution.

  # Prevent mkinitrd from requiring the dm-mem-cache module. This can be accomplished by executing the following commands as root:

  # echo "DMRAID=no" > /etc/sysconfig/mkinitrd/noraid
  # chmod 755 /etc/sysconfig/mkinitrd/noraid

More information on what this means can be found [http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-16528 here]

== Software Installation ==

=== Installing Java ===

Get the latest version of the Java jdk from [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp Sun's website].

Clear instructions on how to perform the installation can be found [http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-set-java_home-path-variable/ here]. (See the comments by Mustafa Buljubasic)

=== Installing eXist ===

Get the latest stable version of the eXist xml database from [http://exist.sourceforge.net/download.html here].

Install it by typing the following command as root

  # java -jar eXist-{version}.jar -p /usr/local/exist

Note: this will create the admin user with a blank password - so you must set this as soon as possible afterwards to secure your database.

== General Hints ==

This section contains some general information about how to perform some of the commonly used tasks in CentOS

=== Package Management with YUM ===

su -c 'yum install tsclient' (Installs tsclient)
su -c 'yum update tsclient' (Updates tsclient to the latest version)
su -c 'yum remove tsclient' (Removes tsclient from the system)
su -c 'yum list tsclient' (Searches for package named tsclient)
su -c 'yum list tsc\*' (Search using wildcard)

=== Required Packages ===

  * ImageMagick
  * subversion
  * ffmpeg
