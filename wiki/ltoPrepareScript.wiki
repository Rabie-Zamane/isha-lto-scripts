#The script run to prepare the files for being archived to lto tape

= Introduction =

This script performs the following functions (for each session-device folder):
  * Updates xml database with new media ids and selected additional media metadata
  * Creates PAR2 error correction files
  * Creates tar files (on staging disk)
  * Creates session-device "tar" xml element (includes calculating md5 hashes and block offsets for each file). This will be the tar element part of the main lto index xml file.
  * Creates preview video files

Step by step script functions

Note: As a first step, the user is expected to have created the necessary events/sessions in the transcript studio application and made a note of the session-ids.

The script is called with 2 arguments: (session-id, device-id).

The script must be called in a directory containing either a single "BPAV" folder (new videos), or a collection of .mov files (old videos). The script will perform different routines based on which it finds.
