Since we need to archive our media data (video, audio and image) for a long time in the future, we wanted a backup system that was as open as possible, and did not lock us into a proprietary piece of software. For this reason we decided to make our own system, making use of freely available open source tools on the linux platform, and using open standards (such as xml) where possible.

This is a set of scripts written in Python to prepare, backup, verify and restore media data to and from LTO tapes.
